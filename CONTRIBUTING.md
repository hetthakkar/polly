## Code contributions

### Getting Started

Make sure you have 

i) Docker installed.
ii) Visual studio code for development.

That's it. Having docker is the only requirement. All that is needed to get started and running the application code is docker-compose up.

- When ready to submit, raise a pull request and describe the feature/bug fix thoroughly in the description. Also add a link to the issue if relevant




### Commit guide

All commit messages must follow the [conventional commit specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This helps others to easily understand commit logs and allows for automated changelog generation. Here's an example of a commit message that follows the conventional commit spec

    feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

In general, the messages must follow the following syntax

    <type>[optional scope]: <description>

    [optional body]

    [optional footer(s)]


### PR Raising guide

All PR raised must follow the following pattern:

i) Ensure that there is atleast an issue created for the code you are pushing.
ii) Raise a new Issue on the Github if the issue doesn't exist.
ii) Start working on the code for the same.
iii) List the issues fixes in the PR description. Following is an example :- https://github.com/shahrk/polly/pull/28
