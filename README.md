<h1> üíé What is Poll Me about? </h1>

Poll Me is a super tool for getting feedback using online polls to let you check in with your audience or customers at any time. Do you want to get the opinion of many people on a certain matter, but haven't found a device that supports a large number of users yet? Then Poll Me is the right place for you. With Poll Me, you can create instant polls, check on the live user feedbacks and gain access to our vibrant Analytics dashboard to get insight into your poll results. Poll Me enables the creation of robust polls that support the use of a large number of users. Each host can create their own virtual room where they can publish their questions and share them with a large number of people. With pre-built survey templates, different survey types can be created and the results can be viewed by both host and player after answering the question.

<h1>Deployment details P1 </h1>

<h2>Backend</h2>

The backend API is deployed on AWS Lambda using the [serverless framework](https://www.serverless.com/). Automated deploys are setup via a Github action that detects pushes to the main branch in the backend directory present in the project root. The action performs the following steps
- Install dependencies using `npm install`
- Generate prisma client(more about Prisma ORM in `./backend/README.md`)
- Push pending migrations to the database
- Deploy the service on AWS Lambda

The above action requires the following environment variables to be set

- `DATABASE_URL` (URL of your postgres database)
- `SERVERLESS_ACCESS_KEY`(Access key for the serverless framework generated from the [serverless dashboard](https://app.serverless.com))
- `JWT_SECRET`(Key used to sign auth tokens using JWT)
- `ALLOWED_ORIGIN`(Origins that are allowed via CORS)

When a service is deployed to AWS via the serverless framework, the following things happen

- Code is zipped and pushed to an S3 bucket
- API gateway service is created(as we use `http` events for our lambda functions)
- An aws lambda function is created/updated for each function defined in the `serverless.yml` file

<h2> Frontend </h2>

Frontend of the application is deployed on [Netlify](https://netlify.com). Netlfiy detects changes to the front end and creates a production optimized build by running the command

    npm run build

The static site assets are then served via Netlify's CDNs. 

Note: There are many other providers that provide static site deployments like Vercel, AWS Amplify, etc that can be swapped for Netlify in this project

<h1> üöÄ Local development setup </h1>

<h2> Backend </h2>

- Switch to backend directory
 
      cd backend
- Install dependencies
 
      npm i
- Create and populate `.env` file from the `env.example` template
- Generate prisma client
 
      npx prisma generate
- Start local serverless API 
 
      npx serverless offline      
            
Performing database changes(Refer [prisma docs](https://www.prisma.io/docs/))

- Make your schema changes in the `prisma/schema.prisma`
- To create a migration, use the command

      npx prisma migrate dev --name <migration_name>

<h2> Frontend </h2>

- Switch to frontend directory

<h1>Deployment details P2 </h1>

By using docker we could deploy the whole system in one single command : 

    ‚ÄúDocker compose up‚Äù

The above single command set up the whole environment and downloads the dependencies to make it run seamlessly on any platform.


<h1> ‚úÖ Things that have been done in Phase 1 </h1>

* Designing the Wireframe
* Basic architecture design and implementation
* Backend API implemented using serverless framework
* Front end mobile UI implemented using React
* Database design and schema implementation using Prisma

Live preview available at https://gracious-swirles-4a8c61.netlify.app

<h1> ‚úÖ Things that have been done in Phase 2 </h1>

* Improvment of the UI
* Architechture Enhancement using Bootstrap
* Dockerization
* Centralized Database
* Dynamic Loading of the Poll questions 

You can check https://github.com/shahrk/polly/blob/main/docs/Enhancement.pdf for enhancement details in P2.  

<h1> Future scope </h1>

1. There can be few ready-to-use templates for conducting polls such as Event/Trivia/Business etc.
2. The App can provide contacts of audiences on the homepage for the admins to sent polls to.
3. The pool of audience can be devided into different categories such as students, bikers, science enthusiasts, group of believers etc. Then the admin can select categoris which they want to send their questions for polling. 
4. Analytics can be extended to see the responses in different geograpic locations.
